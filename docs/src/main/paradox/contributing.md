# Welcome!

We follow the standard GitHub [fork & pull](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#fork--pull) approach to pull requests. Just fork the official repo, develop in a branch, and submit a PR!

For a more detailed description of our process, please refer to the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/akka/akka-http/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) page on the github project.
